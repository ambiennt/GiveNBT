# givenbt
/give items with custom NBT on BDS + ElementZero 1.16.20-.40

syntax:
/givenbt <target: target> <item id: int> [count: int] [aux value: int] [enchantments: string] [custom name: string] [lore line 1: string] [lore line 2: string] [lore line 3: string] [lore line 4: string] [lore line 5: string]

The 2 necessary parameters to this command are the target selector and the item ID. Even without adding NBT, this command may still be useful to give illegal items to players, because the command checks for the numerical item ID instead of its string name.

an example of the command:
/givenbt @a 247 100 0 "9:20,18:5" "my netherreactor core" "ยง6This is a special item from minecraft pocket edition!" "ยงc*note:" "ยง7this is just a decorative block"

Something important to note about the enchantment string parameter is the delimiters. Use the : to separate enchantment ID from level, and , to separate individual enchantments.
